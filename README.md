# To_Do_Task
## Objective
### The objective was to create a completely functional To-DO web application.
## Result
### I was not able to attain the expected the result, because of me not knowing CSS and JS very well. However, I did get a lot of basic functions right. I was never able to figure out how to input multiple data, such as dates and descriptions, while displaying only the title. I was also not able to figure out how to strike through the text on click, and as a result, was unable to complete the "Clear Completed" button as well. 
## To improve
### This is something I want to continue working at. I want to meet all the requirements, while improving over design and usability.
